Mini Project 1


To Run Program: make test

During Execution: Program will prompt user to enter a value for which problem to solve.

To test another problem, run make test again and enter a new number. Program doesn't loop.


NOTE:
  Problem 5, with keyLength = 6, will not run. I get a bad_alloc error, saying i haven't allocated enough memory to the program.
  
  
FINDINGS:
	1: CAESARS WIFE MUST BE ABOVE SUSPICION
	2: FORTUNE WHICH HAS A GREAT DEAL OF POWER IN OTHER MATTERS BUT 
		ESPECIALLY IN WAR CAN BRING ABOUT GREAET CHANGES IN A
		SITUATION THROUGH VERY SLIGHT FORCES
	3: EXPERIENCE IS THE TEACHER OF ALL THINGS
	4: IMAGINATION IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN KNOWLEDGE
	5: not enough space to run properly, but it's no different than the 			previous ones
	
	I decided to store the dictionary in a map that kept track of the 
	word, as well as it's length. This is so I don't have to search the 		dictionary every single time for words of the correct length.
